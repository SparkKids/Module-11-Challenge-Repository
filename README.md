# Module-11-Challenge-Repository
This is the repository for the module 11 challenge.
## Description
This is a note taker application. It allows you to save notes that you have typed in a local JSON file (db.json). When you navigate to the notes page, you are presented with a list of notes in a chronological list on the left hand side of the screen. Clicking on a note title from the list, displays the note title and text on the right hand side of the screen, and displays a "New Note" button in the upper right hand corner of the screen. Clicking on the "New Note" button, blanks out the note title and note text fields and allows a new note to be entered. Once the title and text fields have been entered, a "Save Note" button and a "Clear Form" button are displayed in the upper right portion of the screen. Clicking the "Save Note" button, saves the note to the database, adds the note to the database, blanks out the note title and note text fields to allow a new note to be entered, and adds the new note to the note titles on the left hand side of the screen.  If you hit the "Clear Form" button after entering a note, the the note title and note text fields are blanked out to allow a new note to be entered. To delete a note, click on the "trash can" icon to the right of a note title in the notes list.
